# What is this?
This is a collection of implementations of basic algorithms/datastructures.... that I create while (re)learing C.
Use at your own risk, but I'll try to mark known-buggy implementations as such. Also there will be rudimentary tests for each one.

These implementations will most likely not be the most efficient. I just want to have working(tm) stuff.
